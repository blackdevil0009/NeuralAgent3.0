- 🚀 **CLI Powerhouse**: Exposes an easy-to-use Command Line Interface (CLI) for power users to manage the assistant entirely from the terminal.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

Built with modern, robust technologies ensuring high performance and a premium feel:

- **Frontend**: React, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, Three.js
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, Socket.io
- **AI Core**: Google Gemini Live API, Glowe Agent
- **System**: Windows API, Decibri (Microphone integration)

## 🔑 Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have obtained the necessary API Keys:

- [Google Gemini API Key](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)

## 🚀 Quick Start & Installation

You can use IRIS-MINI as a globally installed CLI (Recommended) or run it locally from the source code for development.

### Option A: Global CLI Installation (The Primary Path)

The most robust way to experience IRIS is directly through your terminal.

> **⚠️ Important Requirement:** IRIS-MINI strictly requires **Node.js v24+**. Please ensure your environment is updated before proceeding.

#### Step 1: Install Globally
Install the package globally via npm to make the `iris` command available everywhere on your system:

```bash
npm install -g iris-mini
```

#### Step 2: First Run Experience
Launch the assistant for the first time:

```bash
iris
```

On this initial run, an interactive **Setup Wizard** will launch. It will guide you to:
1. Input your **Gemini API Key**.
2. Select your preferred **Voice Personality** (Choose between the crisp tones of *Lyra* or *Puck*).

*Note: Subsequent runs will completely bypass this setup, instantly booting the Neural Core and dropping you straight into the Voice AI experience.*

### Option B: Local Development & Hacker Setup

If you want to poke around the codebase, tweak the UI, or contribute to the project, follow this path.

#### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/201Harsh/IRIS-Mini.git
cd IRIS-Mini
```

#### 2. Install Dependencies

Ensure you are on Node.js v24+, then run:

```bash
npm install
```

#### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory based on the following template. Replace the placeholders with your actual API keys:

```env
# Google Gemini API Key for Voice AI
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here

```

#### 4. Ignite the Core

Start both the backend server and the React frontend concurrently in development mode:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Option C: Docker Deployment

For headless environments, homelab servers, or cloud deployments, IRIS-MINI comes fully containerized out-of-the-box.

> **Note:** Running via Docker disables local Windows integrations and native microphone access due to container isolation. It is best suited for network-level access or backend services.

Launch the full stack in detached mode:

```bash
docker-compose up -d --build
```

## 🚑 Troubleshooting & Common Issues

Encountering issues? Here are the most common hurdles and how to bypass them:

- **"Unsupported Engine" Error during `npm install`:**
  You are running an older version of Node.js. IRIS-MINI enforces strict environment rules via `.npmrc`. You **must** update to Node.js v24+.

- **Voice AI / Microphone Not Working (Windows):**
  Windows may block terminal apps from accessing your microphone by default. Go to **Windows Settings > Privacy & security > Microphone** and ensure that "Let desktop apps access your microphone" is turned **ON**.
